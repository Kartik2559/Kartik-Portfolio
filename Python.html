								<h2>Movie Correlation using Python</h2>
								<p></p>
								
								<h3>In the project 'Movie Correlation using Python', I utilized my skills in data analysis and visualization to investigate the factors that affect gross revenue from movies. I obtained data from Kaggle in a .csv format and used Python and its libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, etc.) to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This included handling null values and creating a new column for the year of release.</h3>
								<p></p>
								<h3>I then formulated and tested two hypotheses about the factors that affect gross revenue from movies. Through my analysis, I was able to conclude that one of the hypotheses was correct and the other was not. I used various techniques and tools, such as scatter plots, linear regression, correlation matrices, and heat maps, to support my conclusions.</h3>	
								<p></p>
								<h3>Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in using Python and its libraries for data analysis and visualization, as well as my ability to think critically and use data to support or refute hypotheses. It also showcases my ability to manipulate and visualize data in a clear and concise way, as well as my attention to detail in cleaning and preparing data for analysis.</h3>
