									<h2>Data Cleaning in SQL</h2>
									<p></p>
									<h3>In the project 'Data Cleaning in SQL', I utilized my skills in SQL to transform raw housing data from Kaggle into a more usable form for analysis. I used SQL Server Management Studio to perform various data cleaning tasks, including altering, updating, joining, changing data types, removing duplicates, and dealing with null values.</h3>
									<p></p>
									<h3>This project demonstrates my proficiency in using SQL to manipulate and clean data, as well as my attention to detail in ensuring that the data is accurate and ready for analysis. It also showcases my ability to use SQL Server Management Studio effectively and efficiently to perform data cleaning tasks.</h3>	
									<p></p>
									<h3>Overall, my skills in SQL have been invaluable in a variety of projects and have allowed me to make a significant impact in project. I am confident in my ability to deliver value to any team or project that requires data cleaning and manipulation using SQL.</h3>
